# red — rust editor

A terminal text editor with a VS Code-style layout and keybindings. Not modal, nothing like vim.

## Goals
- Works the way VS Code does, inside a terminal
- Mouse and keyboard both fully supported
- Starts fast, stays light on memory
- Smooth editing on files up to 1 MB
- Platforms: macOS first, Linux later
- Terminals: only those that implement the kitty keyboard protocol — see [Terminals](#terminals)

## Non-goals
- Vim emulation or modal editing
- A plugin system (for now)
- Windows support
- Code folding
- Git beyond viewing and staging (commit, branch, push, …)
- Chorded keybindings (e.g. Cmd+K Cmd+D); every binding is a single key combo
- Terminals without the kitty keyboard protocol (stretch goal)
- _TBD_

## Stack
| Concern | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TUI rendering | `ratatui` | |
| Terminal I/O and input | `crossterm` | mouse, key events, kitty keyboard protocol, bracketed paste |
| Text buffer | `ropey` `=2.0.0-beta.1` | rope, byte-indexed; still beta: pin exact version, only `buffer` touches its API |
| Graphemes | `unicode-segmentation` | cursor movement and deletion by grapheme cluster |
| Display width | `unicode-width` | `DisplayCol`: wide CJK, emoji, zero-width |
| Syntax highlighting | `tree-sitter` | lightweight and incremental; needs a grammar per language |
| LSP | `lsp-types` + `tokio` | JSON-RPC over stdio |
| Git | `git2` | mature libgit2 bindings |
| Diff | `imara-diff` | buffer/file diffs for the diff view |
| File watching | `notify` | |
| Config | TOML via `serde` | `~/.config/red/` |
| Fuzzy finding | `nucleo` | Cmd/Ctrl+P, command palette |
| Task terminals | `portable-pty` + `vt100` + `tui-term` | PTY, VT parser, ratatui widget |
| Clipboard | `arboard` + OSC 52 | local clipboard; OSC 52 over SSH |
| Logging | `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` + `tracing-appender` | file logs, rotation |

```
- **Activity bar** (left edge): icons for Explorer, Search, Source Control
- **Side panel**: switches with the activity bar; can be toggled and resized
- **Editor area**: groups with tabs, split horizontally or vertically
- **Bottom panel**: Problems list, task terminals
- **Status bar**: git branch, diagnostic counts, cursor position, language mode, line ending

## Features

### Workspace
- A workspace is a root directory, optionally with a `.workspace` file (TOML) at its root
- Opening:
  - `red <dir>`: workspace root is `<dir>`
  - `red <file>` / `red <file>:<line>[:<col>]`: walk up from the file to the nearest `.workspace`; else use the file's directory
  - `red` with no args: current directory
- `.workspace` contents:
  - Settings overrides (tab size, wrap, …) on top of `~/.config/red/`
  - LSP servers per language (command, args, init options)
  - Task templates (`[tasks]`); merged with global `~/.config/red/tasks.toml`, workspace wins on name clash
  - Excluded paths for explorer, quick open and search (on top of `.gitignore`)
  - File associations (e.g. `SConstruct`, `*.scons` → Python)
- Meant to be committed: no per-user state in it
- Per-user session state (open tabs, splits, layout) lives in `~/.local/state/red/`, keyed by workspace path
- Reloaded live when `.workspace` changes (via `notify`)
- Workspace root is the LSP `rootUri`, task default cwd and search root

**Workspace trust**
- `.workspace` can name commands (LSP servers, tasks); a cloned repo must not run them without asking
- First open of a workspace whose `.workspace` defines commands: trust dialog
  - Lists every command it would run
  - Choices: Trust / Restricted mode
- Restricted mode:
  - No LSP servers or tasks from `.workspace`; servers and tasks from global config still run
  - Editing, git, search all work
  - Status bar shows "Restricted"
- Trust is per user, stored in `~/.local/state/red/trust.toml`, keyed by workspace path + SHA-256 of the command entries
  - Both answers are stored, so Restricted isn't asked again on every open
  - Esc = Restricted
- Re-prompt when the command entries in `.workspace` change
- Command palette: "Manage Workspace Trust"

### Files
- Encoding: UTF-8 only in v1; keep a UTF-8 BOM if present; other encodings open read-only with a warning
- Binary files (NUL bytes) are not opened
- Line endings: detect LF/CRLF per file, keep on save, show in status bar
- Keep (or not) the final newline as it was
- Save is atomic: write temp file in same dir → fsync → rename; keep permissions; write through symlinks to the target
- Saves run off the UI thread; each buffer tracks "save in flight"
- Changed on disk (via `notify`):
  - Ignore events caused by our own saves
  - Clean buffer: reload silently, keep cursors and scroll
  - Dirty buffer: banner — reload / keep mine / show diff
  - Deleted: mark tab as deleted; save recreates it
- Unsaved changes on close tab / quit: prompt save / discard / cancel
- Crash recovery: dirty buffers backed up periodically to `~/.local/state/red/backup/`; offer restore on next start

### Explorer (file tree)
- Lazy-loaded directory tree
- Keyboard: arrows to move, Enter to open, Left/Right to collapse/expand
- Mouse: click to select (folders toggle), double-click to open, scroll
- New, rename and delete for files and folders
  - Keys: Enter open, Space open keeping focus, F2 rename, Delete / Cmd+Backspace delete, Cmd+Alt+N new file, Cmd+Alt+Shift+N new folder (Ctrl+Alt on Linux)
  - New file/folder names may contain `/` to create nested folders
  - Delete moves to the system Trash
- Respects `.gitignore`
- Live refresh through `notify`
- Git status colouring on entries

### Editor
- Multiple cursors — see [Multi-cursor](#multi-cursor)
- Undo/redo with grouped edits
  - Consecutive typing is one step
  - A new step starts when: the cursor moves, ~1 s pause, switching between inserting and deleting
  - Paste, cut and each multi-cursor command are one step each
  - Each step stores the selections from before and after it
- Select with mouse drag, Shift+arrows, double/triple-click
- Clipboard — see [Clipboard](#clipboard)
- Find/replace in the file (regex, case, whole word)
- Auto-indent, bracket matching, auto-close of pairs
- Line numbers, current-line highlight, soft wrap toggle
- Minimap: see [Stretch goals](#stretch-goals)

### Clipboard
- Local: system clipboard through `arboard`
- Over SSH (`SSH_TTY` set) or if `arboard` fails: copy through OSC 52
- Paste from the terminal (Cmd+V) arrives as a bracketed-paste event; handle it the same as clipboard paste
- Copy/cut with an empty selection takes the whole line (VS Code behaviour)
- Multi-cursor copy/paste rules: see [Multi-cursor](#multi-cursor)

### Multi-cursor
The VS Code behaviour, especially Cmd+D and Cmd+Shift+L, is a must-have.

**Model**
- A view holds a list of selections, never a single cursor; one cursor is just a list of length 1
- Each selection has an `anchor` and a `head` (`ByteIdx` — see [Text positions](#text-positions)), plus a remembered `DisplayCol` for up/down movement
- One selection is primary: it's the one scrolled into view and the one shown in the status bar
- Keep the list sorted; after every command merge selections that overlap or sit at the same position
  - Don't merge selections that only touch (e.g. Cmd+D on `a` in `aaaa` must give separate selections)
- Apply an edit at every selection in one transaction, working from the last to the first so earlier offsets stay valid
- One undo step covers the whole multi-cursor edit and restores the selection list from before it; redo restores the selection list from after it

**Commands**
| Action | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Add selection at next match | Cmd+D | Ctrl+D |
| Select all matches | Cmd+Shift+L | Ctrl+Shift+L |
| Skip this match, go to next | Cmd+Alt+D | Ctrl+Alt+D |
| Undo last cursor change | Cmd+U | Ctrl+U |
| Add cursor above / below | Cmd+Alt+Up/Down | Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down (_clashes with GNOME workspace switch_) |
| Cursor at each selected line's end | Shift+Alt+I | Shift+Alt+I |
| Add / remove cursor | Alt+Click | Alt+Click |
| Box (column) select, mouse | Shift+Alt+drag | Shift+Alt+drag |
| Box (column) select, keyboard | Cmd+Shift+Alt+arrows | Ctrl+Shift+Alt+arrows |
| Back to one cursor | Esc | Esc |

- Shift+drag is often grabbed by the terminal for its own selection, so the keyboard box select is the reliable path

**Cmd+D in detail (copy VS Code exactly)**
- With an empty cursor: select the word under it, and match **whole words only** from then on
- With text selected: search for that exact text
- Search starts after the most recently added selection and wraps around the file
- Skip matches that are already selected
- Scroll to show the new selection
- Cmd+Shift+L uses the same matching rules but adds every match at once

**Editing at many cursors**
- Typing, Backspace, Delete, Enter, Tab and indent all run at every cursor
- Word and line movement (Alt/Cmd+arrows, Home/End) move every cursor
- Auto-close pairs and auto-indent apply at each cursor
- Copy joins the selections with newlines
- Paste: if the clipboard has as many lines as there are cursors, give each cursor one line; otherwise paste the whole thing at every cursor
- LSP completion is inserted at every cursor

**Rendering**
- The terminal has only one hardware cursor: put it on the primary selection and draw the others as reversed cells
- Draw a selection background for every selection
- Status bar shows "N selections" when there's more than one

**Performance**
- Cmd+Shift+L on a 1 MB file can create a lot of selections: find matches on the rope without copying it to a string, and apply all edits as one batch
- _TBD: cap the number of selections? VS Code has no cap_

### Splits
- Split right / split down
- Focus groups by keyboard and mouse
- Resize splits by dragging dividers
- Same buffer open in several views

### Syntax highlighting
- tree-sitter grammars + `highlights.scm` queries per language
- Start with C/C++ and Python grammars to match the first LSPs
- Re-parse incrementally on edit
- Initial parse off the UI thread; show plain text until it's ready
- Run highlight queries on the visible range (plus a margin) only
- Above 1 MB: best effort; highlighting off past a configurable limit
- One built-in dark theme, modelled on VS Code Dark+
- Truecolor; fall back to 256 colours where the terminal lacks it
- Custom themes: see [Stretch goals](#stretch-goals)
- Detect language from file extension and shebang

### LSP
- First servers: `clangd`, `pyright`
- SCons: treat `SConstruct`, `SConscript` and `*.scons` as Python
  - SCons injects globals (`Environment`, `Import`, …) that pyright flags as undefined; ship a `__builtins__.pyi` with them (pyright treats its names as built-ins)
  - _Verify early: pyright analyzes files without a `.py` extension when opened with `languageId: python`_
- Server per language set in config / `.workspace`
- Incremental text sync (`didChange` with ranges), never full text per keystroke
- Request `positionEncoding: utf-8`; fall back to UTF-16 — see [Text positions](#text-positions)
- v1 features:
  - Diagnostics (squiggles plus the Problems list)
  - Completion
  - Hover
  - Go to definition (F12)
  - Find references (Shift+F12)
  - Rename symbol (F2)
  - Format document
- Later: code actions, signature help, inlay hints, semantic tokens

### Git (view and stage only)
Everything else (commit, branch, push, pull, …) is done from the command line.
- Source Control panel: staged, unstaged and untracked files, kept up to date through `notify`
- Gutter markers for added, modified and deleted lines
- Diff view, one file at a time:
  - Open it by clicking or pressing Enter on a file in the Source Control panel, or with "Open Changes" in the command palette for the current file
  - An unstaged file shows the working tree against the index; a staged file shows the index against HEAD
  - Side by side (target terminal width > 120 columns)
  - Opens in an editor tab, so it can be split like any other tab
  - Jump to next / previous change
- Stage / unstage a whole file or a single hunk
  - From the diff view and from the gutter
  - Hunks always come from the file on disk, never the buffer
  - Before staging: no outstanding writes to the file
    - Buffer dirty → prompt to save first
    - Save in flight → wait for it to finish
    - Then recompute the diff from disk and stage
- Current branch shown in the status bar (read-only)

### Tasks (throwaway terminals)
- A terminal is spawned for one task, then thrown away when it finishes
- Templates: name, command, cwd, env — in `.workspace` and/or `~/.config/red/tasks.toml` (see [Workspace](#workspace))
- Run from the command palette: "Run Task" (_TBD: shortcut_)
- Each run gets its own tab in the bottom panel
- Runs in a PTY, so tools keep their colours and progress bars
- On exit: show the exit code and keep the output until the tab is closed
- Kill a running task
- Out of scope: a general-purpose interactive shell
- Later: parse compiler errors into the Problems list (`file:line:col`)

### Command palette and search
- Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P: command palette
- Cmd/Ctrl+P: quick open file (fuzzy)
- Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F: search across the workspace (`ignore` + `grep-searcher` crates)

## Keybindings (VS Code defaults)
| Action | macOS | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Command palette | Cmd+Shift+P | Ctrl+Shift+P |
| Quick open | Cmd+P | Ctrl+P |
| Save | Cmd+S | Ctrl+S |
| Close tab | Cmd+W | Ctrl+W |
| Toggle sidebar | Cmd+B | Ctrl+B |
| Focus explorer | Cmd+Shift+E | Ctrl+Shift+E |
| Source control | Ctrl+Shift+G | Ctrl+Shift+G |
| Search in workspace | Cmd+Shift+F | Ctrl+Shift+F |
| Split editor | Cmd+\ | Ctrl+\ |
| Focus group 1/2/3 | Cmd+1/2/3 | Ctrl+1/2/3 |
| Find / replace | Cmd+F / Cmd+Alt+F | Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H |
| Go to line | Ctrl+G | Ctrl+G |
| Comment line | Cmd+/ | Ctrl+/ |
| Move line | Alt+Up/Down | Alt+Up/Down |
| Duplicate line | Shift+Alt+Up/Down | Shift+Alt+Up/Down |
| Undo / redo | Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z | Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z |
| Cut / copy / paste | Cmd+X / Cmd+C / Cmd+V | Ctrl+X / Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V |
| Add next match / all matches | Cmd+D, Cmd+Shift+L | Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Shift+L |
| Toggle panel | Cmd+J | Ctrl+J |

- Configurable through `keybindings.toml`
- Single key combos only — no chords
- A binding can be limited to a context (editor, find widget, palette, explorer, …) so keys like Esc do the right thing
- macOS uses Cmd wherever VS Code on macOS does (a few stay Ctrl, as in VS Code: Go to line, Source control)
- Linux uses Ctrl

### Terminals
- Kitty keyboard protocol required; without it Ctrl+Shift+X = Ctrl+X, Ctrl+H = Backspace, Ctrl+J = Enter, Ctrl+3 = Esc
- Supported: Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, iTerm2 (CSI u on), Alacritty
- Startup: query protocol support (`CSI ? u`); if missing, show a warning that some keys won't work
- Cmd arrives as the Super modifier; crossterm reads it
- Terminals grab many Cmd keys themselves (Cmd+C/V/X/Z/W/Q/T/N; Cmd+K clears screen; Cmd+D splits panes in iTerm2/Ghostty)
  - Ship tested config snippets per supported terminal (`docs/terminals/`) that pass through every Cmd key in the default keymap
  - Also clashes: Cmd+1/2/3 switch terminal tabs, Cmd+F opens terminal find, Cmd+J/B/P in some terminals
  - Snippets also turn on Option-as-Alt on macOS (otherwise Option types ∂, ˆ, …)
- Basic terminals (Terminal.app, etc.): see [Stretch goals](#stretch-goals)

## Architecture
- `app` — event loop, owns all state, sends commands where they need to go
- `workspace` — root detection, `.workspace` loading and live reload, session state paths
- `buffer` — rope, undo history, file I/O, text position types and conversions
- `view` — selection list, scroll; many views can share one buffer
- `selection` — selection list type, merge and transform rules; every command works on the list from day one
- `layout` — tree of splits and groups, maps mouse hits to regions
- `ui` — ratatui widgets (tree, tabs, editor, status bar, palette)
- `syntax` — highlighting, cached per line or range
- `lsp` — client manager, a tokio task per server, channels back into the app
- `git` — status, diff, stage/unstage files and hunks
- `config` — settings, keybindings
- `theme` — maps highlight names and UI elements to colours; built-in dark theme only for now
- Every user action is a named `Command`, so keybindings and the palette go through the same path

### Text positions
- One set of position types, used by every module — no raw `usize` offsets across module boundaries
- Newtypes so mixing units is a compile error:
  - `ByteIdx` — UTF-8 byte offset; **the canonical unit** (selections, edits, undo, views, tree-sitter, search, git hunks)
    - Always on a char boundary; cursors always on a grapheme boundary
  - `LspPos` — LSP line + column in the negotiated encoding (UTF-8 = no conversion; UTF-16 fallback converts)
  - `DisplayCol` — screen column: tabs expanded, wide CJK = 2, grapheme clusters (emoji, combining marks) as one unit
- All conversions live in `buffer::pos`; nothing else converts
- Convert at the boundary: on the way in to / out of tree-sitter, LSP, git, rendering

### Async and blocking work
- tokio runtime for LSP, file watching, git, file I/O, search
- UI thread never blocks; blocking work goes to `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`:
  - `git2` calls (status, diff, stage)
  - File reads and atomic saves
  - Workspace search and directory walks (`ignore`, `grep-searcher`)
  - tree-sitter initial parse
- `git2::Repository` is `Send` but not `Sync`: open one per blocking task, or own it on a single git thread
- `notify` callbacks are synchronous: forward events into a tokio channel
- Main loop: `tokio::select!` over crossterm `EventStream` and app channels
- Render when state is dirty; coalesce bursts of events into one frame; no fixed tick

### Logging
- `tracing` everywhere; never write to stdout/stderr while the UI is up (corrupts the screen)
- Log file: `~/.local/state/red/logs/red.YYYY-MM-DD.log`, rotated daily, keep last 7
- Level from `--log-level` or the `RED_LOG` env var (`EnvFilter` syntax, e.g. `RED_LOG=red::lsp=trace,red::git=debug`); default `info`
- Targets are module paths (`red::app`, `red::buffer`, …) so each can be turned up alone; plus `input` and `panic`
- LSP:
  - `lsp::wire` at `trace`: every JSON-RPC message in and out, tagged with server name
  - Server stderr captured and logged under `lsp::stderr`
- Timing:
  - Span per `Command` with duration
  - Warn on slow frames (> 16 ms render) and slow blocking tasks
- Key and mouse events at `trace` under `input` (for keybinding / terminal debugging)
- Command palette: "Open Log File", "Set Log Level"

### Panic hook
- Installed at startup, before entering raw mode
- On panic:
  - Back up dirty buffers to `~/.local/state/red/backup/` (best effort)
  - Restore the terminal: pop kitty keyboard flags, disable mouse capture and bracketed paste, leave alternate screen, disable raw mode
  - Write the panic message and backtrace to the log
  - Then print them to stderr

## Milestones
1. ✅ **Skeleton**: open a file, edit, save, scroll, status bar
   - Selection list from the start; undo transactions and grouping
   - Text position types (`buffer::pos`); grapheme-aware movement, display width
   - Files: UTF-8 check (keep BOM), refuse binary, detect and keep LF/CRLF, keep final newline
   - Unsaved-changes prompt on quit
   - Kitty keyboard protocol on; terminal check at startup
   - Panic hook; logging; atomic save
   - Done when: a 1 MB CRLF file can be opened, edited, undone/redone and saved back byte-identical, with no lag; a panic leaves the terminal usable
2. ✅ **Layout**: workspace root, `.workspace` loading and trust dialog, activity bar, explorer tree, tabs, mouse support
   - Deferred: "Manage Workspace Trust" (needs the palette, M5), git colouring in the explorer (M8), external changes to open files (Files section)
3. **Splits**: editor groups, resizing, focus switching
4. **Highlighting**: grammars and the built-in dark theme
5. **Palette**: command palette, quick open, keybinding config with contexts
6. **LSP**: clangd and Python — diagnostics, completion, hover, go to definition
7. **Multi-cursor**: Cmd+D, Cmd+Shift+L, add above/below, Alt+Click, box select, paste spread across cursors
8. **Git**: SCM panel, gutter markers, side-by-side diff view, stage/unstage hunks
9. **Tasks**: templates, PTY runner, task tabs in the bottom panel
10. **Sessions**: restore open tabs, splits and layout per workspace
11. **Polish**: workspace search, settings, performance

## Stretch goals
Very low priority. Don't build these yet, but don't make design choices that would block them.

### Basic terminals
- Terminals without the kitty keyboard protocol (Terminal.app, plain xterm, …)
- Needs a separate fallback keymap: many Ctrl/Ctrl+Shift combos can't be told apart, Cmd isn't sent at all
- **Keep in mind when designing:**
  - Keymaps are data, selected at startup; no key combos hard-coded in commands

### Minimap
- Drawn with Braille characters (2×4 dots per cell), about 4 lines of code per row
- Coloured with the main syntax colour in each cell
- Shaded band for what's on screen; click or drag to scroll
- Scrolls along with the editor on long files
- Marks where each cursor is
- Setting to turn it on and off
- **Keep in mind when designing:**
  - `layout`: an editor view can reserve a column on its right edge
  - `syntax`: highlight spans can be read for any range of lines (lazily, cached), not just the visible ones

### Themes
- Load themes from files; include light themes
- _TBD: format — import VS Code JSON themes? own TOML?_
- **Keep in mind when designing:**
  - No colours hard-coded in widgets: everything looks up a named key (`editor.background`, `keyword`, `gutter.added`, …) in the theme
  - The built-in dark theme is just the first theme, defined through the same keys
